# Changelog


## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `gruff-go init` subcommand writes a default `.gruff-go.yaml` to the working directory, mirroring the registry's per-rule enablement, severity, and threshold defaults. Pass `--force` to overwrite an existing file.
- `analyse`, `summary`, `report`, and `dashboard` prompt when no `.gruff-go.yaml` is found and offer to generate one. The prompt is skipped automatically when stdin is not a TTY (CI, scripts), when `--config` or `--no-config` are set, and when the new global `-n` / `--no-interaction` flag is supplied.
- `gruff-go analyse --generate-baseline <path>` writes a fresh-start baseline from a clean scan, rejecting baseline, diff, and display-filter flags that would make the generated file partial.
- Text summaries and setup output now point new users at the concrete `gruff-go analyse --generate-baseline gruff-baseline.json .` workflow, and text summaries show `.gitignore` skip counts when applicable.
- `scripts/dependency-install.sh` and `scripts/dependency-update.sh` install and refresh npm, Go module, and `govulncheck` dependencies for local development.
- `scripts/preflight-checks.sh` now verifies version metadata consistency, runs dependency audits, and supports `--release` to catch an unbumped source version before tagging.


## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-23

First public release of `gruff-go`, a parser-only Go code-quality scanner. CLI commands: `analyse`, `baseline`, `dashboard`, `report`, `summary`, `list-rules`. 41 rules across 9 pillars (40 default-on), strict `.gruff-go.yaml` config, baselines, diff-mode, gitignore-aware discovery, six output formats (text/json/summary-json/sarif/github/html), and a local HTML dashboard.

Schemas `gruff-go.analysis.v0.1`, `gruff-go.config.v0.1`, and `gruff-go.baseline.v0.1` are stable within `0.1.x`.

**Install:** `go install github.com/blundergoat/gruff-go/cmd/gruff-go@v0.1.0` (or `go get -tool ...@v0.1.0` on Go 1.24+). Prebuilt Linux/macOS/Windows binaries are attached to the GitHub Release.

Known limitations: parser-only (no type/SSA analysis yet); HTML dashboard accessibility review ongoing.
